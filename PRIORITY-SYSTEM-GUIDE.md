# Priority System Guide

## Overview

Your CRM's priority system has been enhanced to provide more accurate and actionable lead prioritization. This guide explains how the system works, the improvements made, and recommendations for optimal usage.

## How the Priority System Works

### **Previous System (Status-Based Only)**
- **High Priority**: Only "Interested" leads with >7 days since last contact
- **Medium Priority**: "Contacted" leads with >7 days since last contact  
- **Low Priority**: "Left Voicemail" and "Closed" leads with >7 days since last contact
- **Excluded**: "Not Interested" leads

### **Enhanced System (Score-Based)**
The new system uses a **composite scoring algorithm** that considers multiple factors:

#### **Priority Score Components (0-200 points total)**

1. **Base Status Score (0-100 points)**
   - "Interested": 100 points
   - "Contacted": 80 points
   - "Left Voicemail": 60 points
   - "Closed": 40 points
   - "Not Interested": 0 points

2. **Engagement History Bonus (0-50 points)**
   - 3+ interactions: +30 points
   - 2 interactions: +20 points
   - 1 interaction: +10 points

3. **Recent Activity Bonus (0-30 points)**
   - ≤1 day since last contact: +30 points
   - ≤3 days since last contact: +20 points
   - ≤7 days since last contact: +10 points

4. **Overdue Penalty (-50 to 0 points)**
   - >30 days overdue: -50 points
   - >14 days overdue: -30 points
   - >7 days overdue: -15 points

5. **Information Completeness (0-30 points)**
   - Complete name and address: +20 points
   - Company information: +10 points

#### **Priority Categories**
- **High Priority (150-200 points)**: Immediate attention required
- **Medium Priority (100-149 points)**: Follow up within 24-48 hours
- **Low Priority (0-99 points)**: Follow up when time permits

## Key Improvements Made

### **1. More Granular Scoring**
Instead of broad status categories, each lead gets a specific score based on multiple factors, allowing for better differentiation between leads within the same status.

### **2. Faster Follow-up Times**
- **Interested leads**: Now flagged after 3 days (was 7 days)
- **Contacted leads**: Now flagged after 5 days (was 7 days)
- **Other leads**: Still 7 days but with score-based prioritization

### **3. Engagement History Consideration**
Leads with more interaction history get higher priority, recognizing that engaged leads are more likely to convert.

### **4. Information Quality Bonus**
Leads with complete information get priority boosts, encouraging data quality.

### **5. Overdue Penalty System**
Leads that have been neglected get penalties, ensuring they don't get lost in the system.

## How to Use the Enhanced System

### **Daily Workflow**

1. **Start with High Priority (150-200 points)**
   - These are your most valuable leads
   - Focus on "Interested" leads with recent activity
   - Address overdue reminders immediately

2. **Move to Medium Priority (100-149 points)**
   - "Contacted" leads ready for follow-up
   - "Interested" leads that need re-engagement
   - Leads with good engagement history

3. **End with Low Priority (0-99 points)**
   - "Left Voicemail" and "Closed" leads
   - Leads with incomplete information
   - Very old leads that may need re-qualification

### **Using the Priority Insights Dashboard**

The new **Priority Insights** component provides:
- **Priority distribution**: See how many leads fall into each category
- **Average score**: Understand your overall lead quality
- **Score distribution**: Identify if leads are clustering in certain ranges
- **Status distribution**: See the breakdown by lead status
- **Engagement levels**: Understand interaction patterns
- **Scoring explanation**: Learn how scores are calculated

### **Interpreting Priority Scores**

- **180-200**: Hot leads - call immediately
- **150-179**: Warm leads - call within 2 hours
- **120-149**: Lukewarm leads - call within 24 hours
- **100-119**: Cool leads - call within 48 hours
- **80-99**: Cold leads - email first, then call
- **0-79**: Very cold leads - consider re-qualification

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

### **1. Customize Scoring Weights**
Consider adjusting the scoring weights based on your business:
- Increase status weights if status is your primary indicator
- Increase engagement weights if interaction history is key
- Add industry-specific bonuses (e.g., property type, location)

### **2. Implement Lead Scoring**
Add additional factors:
- **Response time**: How quickly leads respond to outreach
- **Meeting attendance**: Whether leads show up to scheduled meetings
- **Property value**: Higher value properties get priority
- **Geographic proximity**: Local leads get priority
- **Referral source**: Referred leads get bonus points

### **3. Dynamic Follow-up Schedules**
Instead of fixed time thresholds, implement dynamic scheduling:
- **Interested leads**: Follow up every 2-3 days
- **Contacted leads**: Follow up every 4-5 days
- **Left Voicemail**: Follow up every 7 days
- **Closed leads**: Follow up every 14 days

### **4. Lead Lifecycle Management**
Implement lead lifecycle stages:
- **New**: Just imported/created
- **Qualified**: Basic information verified
- **Engaged**: Multiple interactions
- **Proposal**: Proposal sent
- **Negotiation**: In contract discussions
- **Closed**: Deal won/lost

### **5. Automated Priority Updates**
Set up automated processes:
- **Daily priority recalculation**: Update scores every morning
- **Priority alerts**: Notify when high-priority leads are overdue
- **Lead aging reports**: Identify leads that need attention
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor conversion rates by priority level

### **6. Team-Based Prioritization**
For multi-user environments:
- **Owner-based scoring**: Leads owned by specific users get priority
- **Territory-based scoring**: Geographic considerations
- **Expertise-based routing**: Route leads to specialists
- **Workload balancing**: Distribute high-priority leads evenly

## Best Practices

### **1. Regular Review**
- Review priority distribution weekly
- Adjust scoring weights monthly
- Analyze conversion rates by priority level

### **2. Data Quality**
- Ensure complete lead information
- Update statuses promptly
- Add detailed interaction notes

### **3. Consistent Follow-up**
- Stick to priority-based calling order
- Don't skip low-priority leads entirely
- Use the system as a guide, not a rule

### **4. Performance Monitoring**
- Track time-to-first-contact by priority
- Monitor conversion rates by score range
- Identify patterns in high-converting leads

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **All leads showing same priority**
   - Check if statuses are properly set
   - Verify interaction history is recorded
   - Ensure dates are in correct format

2. **High-priority leads not converting**
   - Review scoring weights
   - Check if status progression is accurate
   - Analyze interaction quality

3. **Too many high-priority leads**
   - Increase scoring thresholds
   - Add more penalty factors
   - Implement stricter criteria

### **System Maintenance**

- **Weekly**: Review priority distribution
- **Monthly**: Analyze conversion rates by priority
- **Quarterly**: Adjust scoring weights based on performance
- **Annually**: Complete system review and optimization

## Conclusion

The enhanced priority system provides a more nuanced and accurate way to prioritize your leads. By considering multiple factors beyond just status and time, you can focus your efforts on the leads most likely to convert while ensuring no valuable opportunities are overlooked.

The key to success is using the system consistently and regularly reviewing its performance to ensure it aligns with your business goals and sales process.
